Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program. A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Bioinformatics can be found at http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects.\nHonours in Bioinformatics is to be completed full-time. Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.\nStudents must enrol in BABS4516\u00a0School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.\nThe program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process.

A manager must also be able to deal with people's different motives and with major uncertainties in the decision-making process. Dealing with these issues is the essence of business strategy and economic management. Study in this area provides students with the tools to understand the fundamental economic behaviour that underlies all business decisions. Hence, it allows future managers to make informed decisions throughout their careers.\n\nStrategic decision-making is not only useful for relations with competitors, but for relations with suppliers, customers, business partners, and for the range of relations inside the firm. Employees, managers, shareholders and the board of directors all have different goals, and they behave strategically, not unlike competitors. They also have 'incomplete information'? about each other: Because employees and managers have complex skills and assignments, others cannot perfectly assess them through performance evaluations. And each employee understands certain aspects of the business and its customers better than others. Economics allows managers and owners to structure divisions, teams and salary packages for employees to gain the highest profits. The flexibility of strategic thinking tools from economics allows a manager to deal with any new situations that arise - be it new research projects, start-up businesses, or business alliances.",

Many systems, from search engines to financial systems and health systems employ AI techniques such as machine learning. While true 'intelligence' via computers is still remote, AI techniques are increasingly being used to enhance the performance of a vast range of existing systems, and to enable new applications, especially those involving large amounts of data.\n\nIn many applications (e.g. driverless vehicles), AI allows existing systems to work with less and less manual intervention. As autonomous devices become more common, potential employers include companies that can make ready use of automation. This includes companies concerned with home and office automation, entertainment companies and autonomous systems research and development. Autonomous systems and the sophisticated sensors they employ are also adopted in many industries to enhance production and to improve safety (e.g. mining, manufacturing, transport).\n\nThis stream introduces students to the foundations of artificial intelligence and the core technologies (machine learning, knowledge representation) that are required to apply AI in the real world.",

Markets for financial instruments also arise because firms and individuals want to manage financial risk. For example, a large corporation may bet against the risk of large fluctuations in the Australian - U.S. dollar exchange rate by selling its goods by way of futures contracts. Understanding how the prices of financial instruments are determined in the market place is a central concern of financial economics, along with the design of new financial derivatives.\n\nThe area of financial economics that deals with the study of real-world data is known as financial econometrics. Financial econometrics is concerned with the statistical analysis of financial data and testing the real-world applicability of asset-pricing theories.

Established financial services firms (BigTech) and entrepreneurs (FinTech) both demand talent in this space as FinTech products are by nature scalable and have potential for huge impact in a financial services business.\n\u00a0\nCo-developed with financial services industry experts, this major introduces students to finance theory, financial products, markets, and institutions, then explores how big data and other technologies allow FinTech start-ups to cause consumers to shift away from traditional finance - fundamentally changing the way money is raised, transferred, stored, loaned, and invested around the world. In addition to a conceptual understanding of finance theory, financial markets, and financial services firms, students will experience FinTech courses via the Integrated Learning Laboratory (iLab). They will be able to gain personal access to financial market data platforms, handle financial market and unstructured data, learn how financial products work via the Python programming language, trade using the leading stock trading platform used by brokerage firms, and interact with practitioners.\n\u00a0\nThe Bachelor of Commerce (Financial Technology) major can be taken standalone or be taken to complement other streams of studies such as finance, information system, computer science, engineering, law, and more. It is also available as a minor for students with a constrained degree program.",

Students are expected to formulate their project rationale, objectives, literature survey, and project management plan, done formally in MATS4504 Research Training (6UOC), then undertake and complete the work in a timely manner over one term. In most cases the project will involve substantial experimental work and this is usually done within established research groups in the School as well as in collaboration with other groups in the University and elsewhere.\nThe principal form of teaching is based on research supervision and direction by specialist researchers within the School of Materials Science and Engineering. Complementing this, students must complete MATS4503 Professional Skills (6UOC) which includes formal training in professional communication, writing skills, project planning, data analysis, intellectual property, and risk management and workplace safety.\nLearning outcomes from this Honours stream will form the basis for future pursuits in materials science research but are also highly relevant for many other professions - both within the materials industry, but also in many other related yet diverse fields.\nThe School offers a wide variety of student research projects in the Materials Science discipline including topics on synthesis and production of advanced materials, materials recycling, functional materials, sustainable materials, advanced surface coatings, electrical materials, biomedical materials, physical metallurgy, process metallurgy, etc. Most students would complete Honours as full-time students, where the program is completed over three consecutive terms. Part-time study is also possible depending on availability of supervision and suitable projects. Most students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (February) but Term 3 (September) entry\u00a0is available.

        "description": "The Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream is designed for students with a mechanical engineering major whose interests also lie in realising, commercialising and implementing mechanical and mechatronic systems and designs. The five core courses included as part of this stream have been designed on the basis of world best practice in manufacturing and industrial engineering and reflect a top-down - bottom-up approach, spanning the disciplines of Strategy and Management, Operations and Supply Chains, Analysis and Decision-making, Design of Product-Process Systems and Technology & Automation.\n\nWithin each discipline area this new stream will cover many conceptual and analytical techniques, all supporting fact- and data-based analysis and decision making with the aim of improved product and process performance, economy and sustainability. This stream is designed to help you to learn how to transform a design from a conceptual stage into a prototype and ultimately into a commercially realisable and viable product. This stream focuses on technical as well as commercial aspects and particularly in developing the ability to build a business or commercial case for making engineering related decisions, such as investment in plant, equipment and processes. Although the main emphasis will be on product and process, consideration will also be given to designing compatible and appropriate engineering support services. The stream also emphasises the strategic impact of operations decisions and the interfaces between operations and the other functional areas of organisations, including of course, finance. This stream encompasses the key elements of operations management and investment analysis and pulls them together in a coherent format that allows you to understand the 'big picture' as well as 'the specific details'. It is aimed at integrating the knowledge gained from the mechanical engineering courses you have studied into a framework and process that allows you to implement your designs, solutions and ideas in a commercial environment.\n\nMechanical engineers have traditionally played the major role in the analysis and design of complex machinery, devices such as actuators and sensors, as well as energy transformation, heat transfer and electro-mechanical processes. In an environment of global competition, sustainability (energy, environment as well as cost and capital), increasingly complex customer requirements and statutory regulations as well as the increasing pace of technological change and new product innovation, it is vital for modern engineers to possess the skills to not only design but equally importantly, implement and realize their designs in the most appropriate way. In this increasingly complex environment, successful organizations - public, private or governmental - need engineers with analytical and diverse skills, especially in integrating technical with commercial and organisational issues, analyses and ultimately solutions. It is the purpose and aim of the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream to equip you with this knowledge and understanding to become a global engineer, indeed a leader, with the ability to apply analytical methods and quality processes to create short and long term value for your organization, your customers, and the community. It encapsulates the key elements of mechanical engineering and combines them with the five core disciplines of manufacturing and industrial engineering.\n\nAn engineer trained in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering may be employed in a very flexible and diverse range of disciplines and areas of industrial activity, including; product design, process design, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, quality improvement, technical and commercial analysis and decision making, strategic decision making, consulting, sales support, technical and organisational maintenance, and supply chain management.",

Year 1 of the stream includes courses that cover the sciences to provide the foundation for many of the engineering courses offered in Year 2. Year 3 is largely devoted to fundamental courses in mining engineering while Year 4 provides advanced instruction in aspects essential for all mining engineers. Elective courses are offered in both Year 3 and Year 4 of the stream.\nAn important requirement in the fourth year is for students to undertake personal research or a study project in mining or minerals engineering for which they are required to submit a dissertation for examination. After graduation, mining engineers who choose to develop careers in operations management gain further practical experience to obtain a Mine Manager's Certificate of Competency, in either Coal or Metalliferous Mining. Formal arrangements are in place with the University of Newcastle for students who have completed a specified program to be admitted with advanced standing to Year 3 of the program at UNSW. Recognition of students from other institutions or graduates of other disciplines may also be considered for advanced standing to the stream.\nStream Structure\nThe stream structure shown indicates one sequence of courses that fulfils the requirements of the stream rules.\nAs the stream structure indicates, a number of course electives are offered each semester in Year 3 and Year 4. This allows the student to specialize in systems of mining either surface or underground or both; in advanced studies of core technical fields; or, opt for a broader professional perspective.\nPart of the requirements for MINE4710 Mine Management is completion of 60 days of industrial training and submission of a report on the work undertaken.",

The solutions to many national and global problems are often intricately connected with regional and global processes, structures,mechanisms, forces, interests, customs and institutions. Knowing how to identify these solutions,their context and histories, is often challenging, frequently rewarding, and always interesting. A major stream in Politics and International Relations will give you insight into the complex relationships between state and non-state actors, individuals and organisations in national and international contexts, and you will learn how to think critically about the nature of power in contemporary and historical perspective.",
